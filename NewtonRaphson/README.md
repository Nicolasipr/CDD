# Newton Raphson method

This code will grab an argument from the command line and it will solve a polynomial of degree d ∈ ℕ. Or at least it will
show an approximation of the current root of that polynomial f(x).
 
We all know Newton Raphson or Newton Fourier iteration method of root finding, and it can easily solve non-linear equations

and given the value of x = xi at the end of the ith iteration, we obtain xi+1 as:

As far as our code does, it shows some of the real roots, since part of the complex roots were not part of this assigment. 
If some polynomial has k same roots, it's going to display a single root value.

## How it works
We have divide the code in several functions to make it more easy to read and comprehend. 
### Functions
    .
    ├── ...
    ├── sortBySec(pair a, pair b)                      # Helps to selects the exponent side of pair vector and order it
    ├── StringtoLongDouble(argc, **argv)     # Parse the command line argument to long double useful data in a vector of pairs.
    ├── derivating()                                            # It derivatives polynomial p(x) into p(x)'
    ├── PowerCalc()                                            # pre-compute all the polynomial power of degree d, saves it into a vector.
    ├── fxCalc(x_0)                                             # Evaluates both p(x) and p(x)' with a value of x_0 given
    ├── NewtonRaphson()                                 # Uses all functions from above to calculate its roots
    └── ...

#### SortBySec(pair a, pair b): Sort by Exponent
This piece of code right here returns the comparison of pairs by its second attribute. In order to sort the polynomial entity 
we had to sort it to dislay it effectively. It is now completely necessary but we did it in order to comprehend or data better.

```cpp
bool sortBySec(const pair<int,int> &a, 
              const pair<int,int> &b){ 
    return (a.second > b.second); // helps to sort by segment of pair (exponent)
} 
```
This segment of code it's used in this specific part of our work, right here: 
```cpp 
 sort(polynomium.begin(), polynomium.end(), sortBySec); 
```

#### StringtoLongDouble(argc, **argv): String to Long Double 
#### derivating():   
#### PowerCalc(): Computes all Powers of X P
#### NewtonRaphson(): 

It's meant to work under this command line input: 

```
$ ./programa "some polynomial input"
```

If you haven't compile it you can still do it by running this line of code under your command line:

```
$ g++ -std=c++11 programa.cpp -o programa
```
 That creates and executable that can be used as shown above.
